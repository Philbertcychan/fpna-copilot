Subject: Monthly FP&A Executive Summary

Dear Directors and VPs,

I am writing to provide a brief summary of our financial performance for the first four months of the year. 

1. Revenue vs Budget: Our revenue performance has consistently exceeded budgeted figures across all months, with a variance of $5,000 each month. This represents a positive variance percentage ranging from 3.7% to 4.35%. 

2. Expenses vs Budget: On the expense side, we have seen a similar trend where actual expenses have exceeded budgeted expenses by $5,000 each month. This translates to a variance percentage ranging from 5.56% to 6.67%. 

3. Trends and Risks: While it is positive to see revenues exceeding budget, the consistent overage on the expense side is a trend that needs attention. If this trend continues, it could potentially offset our revenue gains and impact our bottom line. 

4. Recommendations: It is recommended that each department closely monitor their expenses and identify areas for potential savings to bring expenses in line with the budget. Additionally, we should continue to focus on revenue-generating activities to maintain or increase the positive revenue variance. 

In conclusion, while we are performing well in terms of revenue, there is a need to control expenses to ensure overall financial health. 

Please let me know if you need any further details or clarification on any points.

Best Regards,
